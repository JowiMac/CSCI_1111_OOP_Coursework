# Probability Calculator

## Synopsis
This project compares dice and cards

## Motivation
I built this code to make probability calculations faster

## How to Run
"Probability.java" and "ProbabilityTest.java" are needed to run the latest version.
"probProj" is an old project of an earlier version of the Probability calculator.

## Code Example
'''
Obj2.getProbability();
'''
This is what I am most proud of in my code (line 168 in ProbabilityTest.java) because
the code would not output the correct information until this was added. I am also proud
of it also becuase I was able to insert objects into an array list and reference them
with shorter names.

## Tests
Run JUnit4 to test the methods. I used multiple methods to receive an end result.
Make sure to add all necessary methods to return a positive result.

## Contributors
I had used Eclipse to run my Java code
I, John Macdonald created this code
